Fixed Player Class and added BeverageItem extending the class Item.

Similar to the FoodItem, but BeverageItem replaces satietyLevel with
quenchLevel field.

Player class has methods for eat() and drink(). They function the same but the
only difference is that the former takes FoodItem parameter, and mutates the
hungerLevel field, while the latter takes the beverageLevel parameter and
mutates the thirstLevel field. Mutations are based from the Food/BeverageItem
satietyLevel/beverageLevel of the taken parameters.
